Instructions: Identify flaws in experimental design and propose corrections.

1. The Sith Lords are concerned that their recruiting slogan, "Give In to Your Anger," isn't very effective. Darth Vader develops an alternative slogan, "Together We Can Rule the Galaxy." They compare the slogans on two groups of 50 captured droids each. In one group, Emperor Palpatine delivers the "Anger" slogan. In the other, Darth Vader presents the "Together" slogan. 20 droids convert to the Dark Side after hearing Palpatine's slogan, while only 5 droids convert after hearing Vader's. The Sith's data scientist concludes that "Anger" is a more effective slogan and should continue to be used.
	- Vader is the face of the empire and may be associated with droids' friends deaths. Their fear--of hatred--of him may have rendered them mute.
	- Droids may be more swayed by a human face than an android-like mask.
		- Correction: Use two storm troopers unknown to droids, have both their faces uncovered.
	- Differences in script: use a script, coach storm troopers to use similar inflections
	- Use similar rooms at similar temperatures, lighting, etc

2. In the past, the Jedi have had difficulty with public relations. They send two envoys, Jar Jar Binks and Mace Windu, to four friendly and four unfriendly planets respectively, with the goal of promoting favorable feelings toward the Jedi. Upon their return, the envoys learn that Jar Jar was much more effective than Windu: Over 75% of the people surveyed said their attitudes had become more favorable after speaking with Jar Jar, while only 65% said their attitudes had become more favorable after speaking with Windu. This makes Windu angry, because he is sure that he had a better success rate than Jar Jar on every planet. The Jedi choose Jar Jar to be their representative in the future.
	- Problem: You sent Jar Jar to the friendly planets and Mace Wendu to the unfriendly plantets. Send each to two friendly and two unfriendly planets.

3. A company with work sites in five different countries has sent you data on employee satisfaction rates for workers in Human Resources and workers in Information Technology. Most HR workers are concentrated in three of the countries, while IT workers are equally distributed across worksites. The company requests a report on satisfaction for each job type. You calculate average job satisfaction for HR and for IT and present the report.
	- Calculate by site as well as overall to avoid Simpson's paradox

4. When people install the Happy Days Fitness Tracker app, they are asked to "opt in" to a data collection scheme where their level of physical activity data is automatically sent to the company for product research purposes. During your interview with the company, they tell you that the app is very effective because after installing the app, the data show that people's activity levels rise steadily.
	- Self selection bias, people who opt in may be the people who intend to start fitness programs. Correction: move to opt-out

5. To prevent cheating, a teacher writes three versions of a test. She stacks the three versions together, first all copies of Version A, then all copies of Version B, then all copies of Version C. As students arrive for the exam, each student takes a test. When grading the test, the teacher finds that students who took Version B scored higher than students who took either Version A or Version C. She concludes from this that Version B is easier, and discards it.
	- Systematic bias: difference between clumps of students arriving at different times? Distribute the test collated.
