    "The probability will be exactly the same for all four combinations. Any specific outcome (i.e., specifying EITHER heads OR tails) to a coin toss has a probability of 0.5. Since the question is about the intersection of four coin tosses, the probability for each set of four coin tosses yielding a specified value is (0.5)^4 or 0.0625."

The probability of not selecting a man given not replacement would be contingent on the number of men and women selected prior to the selection of interest."

    "### Question 4: A data scientist wants to study the behavior of users on the company website. Each time a user clicks on a link on the website, there is a 5% chance that the user will be asked to complete a short survey about their behavior on the website. The data scientist uses the survey data to conclude that, on average, users spend 15 minutes surfing the company website before moving on to other things. What is wrong with this conclusion?\n",
    "There are two potential flaws with using survey data to draw conclusions about overall user behavior. The first is that users are offered a choice about whether or not to take the survey, which introduces the possibility for self-segregation and bias to enter the sample. It is possible that individuals who opt to take ths survey spend ~15 min on the website before moving on, while individuals who opt out of the survey exhibit wildly different browsing patterns. A better method might include invisible trackers that can log user behavior without requiring anyone to take time to complete a survey."
