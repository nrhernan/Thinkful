    "This survey was developed and administered by students of the American University of Armenia, and 93% of respondents were some kind of student. 70% listed themselves as primarily students, while 23% of respondents were working and enrolled in some kind of program. Also, the survey does not specify the language in which it was administered, however we know that it was administered by students of the American University of Armenia, and that these students are English speakers, since the graduate requirements include English proficiency. This suggests, therefore, that the survey was conducted in English. If that was the case, the results may not reflect even the Armenian student population, Since English speaking students may represent a unique demographic among Armenian students."
