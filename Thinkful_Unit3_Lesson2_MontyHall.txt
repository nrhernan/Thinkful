I learned about this problem and its solution during my undergrad orientation. The professor--I've long forgotten his name--explained it by increasing the number of doors from three to 10,000,000 but keeping the rules constant: the host must open all doors except the one selected by the participant and the one with the real prize assuming the door with the prize has not been selected. If it has been seleced, the host chooses a door at random to remain closed. This framing highlights the game show host's choice in keeping one of the doors closed, and the fact that his selecting a door to remain closed is based on his prior knowledge of the car's placement, while the participant's selection was purely random.
